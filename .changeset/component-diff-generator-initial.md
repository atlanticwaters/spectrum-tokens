feat(tools): add component schema diff generator with shared core library

**New Tools:**

- `@adobe/spectrum-component-diff-generator` - CLI tool for comparing component schemas between versions/branches
- `@adobe/spectrum-diff-core` - Shared library providing common diff functionality across tools

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic file discovery using GitHub API
- Breaking vs non-breaking change detection for JSON schemas
- Support for remote-to-remote, remote-to-local, and local-to-local comparisons
- Professional markdown, JSON, and CLI output formats
- Integration with GitHub Actions for automated PR comments
- Comprehensive test coverage with AVA

**CLI Usage:**

```bash
# Compare between versions
sdiff report --osv v1.0.0 --nsv v1.1.0 --format markdown

# Compare between branches
sdiff report --osb main --nsb feature-branch --format json

# Local comparisons
sdiff report --osv v1.0.0 --local packages/component-schemas
```

This enables automated component schema change detection and reporting across Adobe Spectrum's design system workflow.
